    <h1>Glazing MIST 🔥</h1>
    <p>
      Oh, MIST, the Manipal Information Security Team, you shiny knights of the cyber realm! 
      You’re out here slaying at Capture The Flag events and dropping knowledge bombs with your free workshops on cybersecurity, networking, and scripting. 
      Truly, you’re the superheroes of MIT Manipal, guiding newbies through the dark alleys of the internet with your "Cybersecurity for Everyone" vibe. 
      That website of yours? 
      A sleek digital fortress showcasing your achievements and events—talk about a glow-up! 
      And those 26 GitHub repos? Coding wizards, much? 
      You’re basically the cool kids of the tech scene, making everyone want to join your hacker-hangout crew.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, let’s be real, MIST—sometimes you’re too extra. 
      All those “Can someone take this up?” messages and chaotic board meetings? 
      Sounds like you’re running a soap opera called As the Server Crashes. 
      And that “tired seniors with too many inside jokes” energy? 
      Y’all are out here gatekeeping the punchlines like they’re top-secret encryption keys! 
      Also, a C workshop and CTF challenge during TechTatva? 
      Bold move, but are you trying to hack our sleep schedules too? 
      Keep flexing those cybersecurity muscles, but maybe ease up on the “we’re just too cool” aura—it’s giving “sudo rm -rf sleep” vibes.
